<h3>Extra</h3>
The Advanced Movement Module works best for Custom Gamemodes. Some parts will break or fail with Default Gamemodes such as Jumping and taking Falldamage during Climbing.
<br>
<br>
You can Modify some Features by Changing the "Configuration" Variables such as Enabling/Disabling Jumping and Setting some BunnyHopping Parameters. For Existing Custom Gamemodes, they will appear at the right side within the PlayerProxy of your Custom Gamemode.
