<h3>Extra</h3>
The Advanced Movement Module works best for custom gamemodes. Some parts will break or fail with default gamemodes such as jumping and taking falldamage during climbing.
<br>
<br>
You can modify some features by changing the "Configuration" variables such as enabling/disabling jumping and setting some BunnyHopping parameters. For existing custom gamemodes, they will appear at the right side within the PlayerProxy of your custom gamemode.
