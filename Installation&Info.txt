Important: Always create a Backup before making changes!

__________________________________________________________
------------01. Adding AMM to a new Project---------------

1. Extract the zip file and open Pavlov.uproject
2. In the UE4 Editor, go to "Window" and select "Pavlov Workshop".
3. In the Pavlov Workshop window, press the "Create New" button. This will create a new and unique UGCXXX folder inside the *ProjectNameHere*\Content\CustomMaps folder. Close the window
4. Select the "AdvancedMovement" folder and Drag&Drop it into your UGCXXX Folder
4.1 (Optional) Do the same with the "AdvancedMovementExamples" to include the examples
5. Right click the "Content" Folder and select "Fix up Redirectors in Folder"
6. Add your desired Gamelogic, select it and choose the AdvancedMovement Classes below the Definition file
__________________________________________________________
------02. Adding AMM to an existing Default Project-------

1. Extract the zip file and open the Content Folder
2. Copy "AdvancedMovement" and Paste it into your Project's Content Folder
3. Open your Project in Unreal Engine
5. Select the "AdvancedMovement" folder and Drag&Drop it into your UGCXXX Folder
5.1 (Optional) Do the same with the "AdvancedMovementExamples" to include the examples
6. Right click the "Content" Folder and select "Fix up Redirectors in Folder"
7. Select your Gamelogic and choose the AdvancedMovement Classes below the Definition file

__________________________________________________________
------03. Adding AMM to an existing Custom Gamemode-------
1. Follow Step 1-6 from Guide 02.
2. Open the Custom Gamemode's "PlayerProxy" if it exists
3. Select "File" at the top left, select "Reparent Blueprint" and select the AdvancedMovement Object with the type/name
4. Repeat Step 2-3 with "GlobalInfo", "HandProxy" and "PlayerInfo" if they exist.

Keep in mind that Events override their Parent Events. So, using "Event Tick" will disable Event Tick for the Advanced Movement. To fix this, you'll have to replace "Event Tick" and "Event Beginplay" with "Event Tick for Child Actors" and "Event Beginplay for Child Actors"

3. Open Pavlov.uproject
4. Select the "AdvancedMovement" folder and Drag&Drop it into your UGCXXX Folder
4.1 (Optional) Do the same with the "AdvancedMovementExamples" to include the examples
6. Right click the "Content" Folder and select "Fix up Redirectors in Folder"

------------------------Extra------------------------
The Advanced Movement Module works best for Custom Gamemodes. Some parts will break or fail with Default Gamemodes such as Jumping and taking Falldamage during Climbing.

It is recommended to use the recreated Gamemodes instead.



You can Modify some Features by Changing the "Configuration" Variables such as Enabling/Disabling Jumping and Setting some BunnyHopping Parameters. For Existing Custom Gamemodes, they will appear at the right side within the PlayerProxy of your Custom Gamemode.
